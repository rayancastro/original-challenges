## AirBnB Week

You will spend the next 5 days in your Projects group of 3 or 4, working on an AirBnB clone (you don't have to rent **flats**, be creative!)

If possible, try and create a clone that contains a few things you might also need for your Project. So maybe pick a colour scheme / fonts / layout style that you can copy across - it will save you time next week and will make your product even more awesome!

### Demos

You will demo your work (in production, no demo on `localhost`!) on Wednesday and Friday nights. Deadlines matter!

### Kick-start (Monday morning)

Work on the following steps and validate them with a coach on Monday morning before creating your Rails app and starting to code in the afternoon. You will save a lot of time by doing this, trust us.

#### 1 - Mockup and routes

- Download and **print** [this template for your mockup and routes](https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/raw/master/rails/rails-user-stories.pdf).
- Brainstorm on your core routes and associated views (home page, results page, show page, posting a new offer, booking something, checking your bookings, accepting or declining a booking, etc.)

#### 2 - Database Scheme

Draw your database schema using [our db tool](http://db.lewagon.com/) and validate it with a coach. The database schema is the foundation of your app. If your schema is incorrect or overcomplicated, you will really struggle when you start to code.

### Setup (Monday afternoon)

Before splitting the tasks among the team, set your project up together. The **lead developer** (and only him/her) should:

#### 1. Create the Rails project with a Postgres config

Use Le Wagon's minimal template, which already has a good frontend setup:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
rails new \
  --database postgresql \
  --webpack \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/rails-templates/master/minimal.rb \
  CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME
```

Again, only the **lead developer** will do this! Not everyone in the team...

#### 2. Push the project on Github

```bash
cd rails-airbnb-clone
hub create
git push origin master
```

#### 3. Add your team mates as collaborators on the Github repo

Go to [github.com/<user.github_nickname>/rails-airbnb-clone/settings/collaboration](https://github.com/<user.github_nickname>/rails-airbnb-clone/settings/collaboration) and add your teammates as **collaborators** to the repo.

The other teammates can now **clone** the project. ⚠️**Be careful, use `SSH` url**⚠️

Then, the teammates should run:

```bash
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:create db:migrate
```

#### 4. Deploy on Heroku

Even if it's just a skeleton app, it's important to deploy on Heroku **from day one**, and then continuously deploy every day with each new feature.

```bash
heroku create airbnb-<user.lower_github_nickname> --region=REPLACE_WITH_REGION # (eu, us, or any region available in `heroku regions` list)
git push heroku master
heroku run rails db:migrate
```

From this point you can start splitting the tasks. **Spend time on the setup, because everything will be simpler if you do it correctly at the beginning**.

### Some guidelines for project management

#### Kick-off

When trying to split work in your team, you'll realize that many tasks depend on other ones... How to integrate facebook connect if there is no `User` model? How to implement bookings if there is no `Flat` model? Here are some guidelines to help you organize your work:

You must always start with the **core models** in your app that all future features will depend on. In Airbnb's case, they are clearly `User` and `Flat`. Once these models are integrated, it becomes easier to split work on remaining features. As a kick-off phase, you can therefore separate two main tasks:

**group #1 - Model kick-start**:
- Integrate `User` with Devise signin/signup
- Integrate `Flat` with listing (`index`) and creation (`new/create`)

**group #2 - Frontend kick-start**:
- Work on a clean layout with navbar/footer
- Build a simple, attractive home page.

Once both groups are done (it should take you ~2h each) and once you have all merged your work on Github, you can move on and split tasks for the remaining features.

#### Tasks organization

Here is a list of different user stories to implement on the Airbnb project:

- As a user, I can navigate on the website from the navbar (with functional links, e.g. "signin/signout", "My bookings", "Publish an offer", etc.)
- As a user, I can view a flat's page
- As a user, I can book a flat
- As a user, I can add pictures for my flat
- As a user, I can add reviews for a flat I've stayed in
- As a user, I can locate flats on a map
- As a user, I can log in with Facebook
- As a user, I can receive an email when someone books my flat
- ...

**Some of these features are more important than others**. It's your role to prioritize them to get an MVP at the end of the week!

#### Feature example: Book a flat

When you work on a feature, work on it **conscientiously from the database to the HTML/CSS**. Let's take the example of the "booking" feature:

*Model*
- I will create a `Booking` model and its associated migration.
- Then I will write a working model with associations and validations.
- I will then crash-test my model from the `rails console` to make sure everything in the model works.

*Routing*:
- I will add bookings routes in `routes.rb`

*Controller*:
- I will create a new `BookingsController` with the `create` and `index` actions.
- I will implement these two actions.

*Views modification*:
- I will embed the booking form in the existing `views/flats/new.html.erb`
- I will list all current user's bookings on a new page `views/bookings/index.html.erb`.

*Links*:
- I will add a link to the `bookings#index`page in the navbar.

*HTML/CSS*:
- My booking form is clean with the correct Bootsrap classes for the inputs and buttons.
- My new bookings page is clean with a `container` to center the content, clear headers, and a clean design for each booking.
- I will take time to refactor my HTML using partials if my HTML code is too long and hard to read.

**Code it perfectly, from model to view**

- Crash test all your model associations and validations in the rails console.
- Don't neglect the view. If you add a form, make it a nice, centered and responsive Bootstrap form. If you code a flats list, build a nice Bootstrap grid (for example, with flat picture on the left and flat info on the right..).
- Use partials to refactor your HTML and make it more readable and maintainable.
