## Background & Objectives

Build a [responsive signup form](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/10-Login/).

**⚠️ Before starting, read all the instructions carefully.⚠️**. Forms are among the most important components in a website, so you need to know how to design them!

## Grid offset technique

The best trick to make a form responsive is to inject it in a Bootstrap grid with an offset:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4">
      <form action="">
        <!-- Your form content -->
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- The form will be full-size on mobile
- On tablet and larger devices, it will be centered (thanks to the offset) and will take 33% of the screen.
- You can make it even more responsive if you like (fullscreen on mobile, half-screen centered on tablet, 33%-screen centered on laptop etc.)


## HTML forms

A HTML `<form>` is made up of different `<input>` lines (i.e. each field of the form). Each input may have an associated `<label>` or not. The button to submit the form is also an input with the `type="submit"`. Here is what a form looks like:

```html
<form action="#">
  <label for="your-email">Your email</label>
  <input type="email" id="your-email" placeholder="bob@gmail.com">
  <input type="submit" value="Sign In">
</form>
```

1. There are different types of `<input>` (`type="text"`, `type="email"`, `type="date"`, etc.)
2. The `placeholder` is a text example that disappears when the user starts writing.
3. The label `for="something"` will be linked to the input with `id="something"`. Linking labels and inputs is not just for fun. It allows us to click anywhere on that line to make the cursor jump into the associated input (rather than having to click inside the text box). This is much better UX!
4. The `value` attribute gives us the text that is displayed on the submit button.

Dropdown-lists are a bit different. **They have their own `<select>` tag and `<option>` tag for each option of the list**. Their HTML looks like this:


```html
<label for="favorite">What's your favorite language?</label>
<select id="favorite" name="language">
  <option value="ruby">Ruby</option>
  <option value="css">CSS</option>
  <option value="javascript">Javascript</option>
</select>
```


## Bootstrap form classes

Now let's speak about Bootstrap form classes:

- `.form-control` designs every `<input>` or `<select>`, except the submit button.
- `.form-group` groups each `<input>` or `<select>` with its associated `<label>`.

Example of Bootstrap form **with labels**:

```html
<form action="#">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Your email</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" class="form-control">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="password">Your password</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" class="form-control">
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Sign In" class="btn btn-primary">
</form>
```

Example of Bootstrap form **without labels**:

```html
<form action="#">
  <div class="form-group">
    <input type="email" class="form-control">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <input type="password" class="form-control">
   </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Sign In" class="btn btn-primary">
</form>
```

Now if you want a horizontal form you can **add the `.form-inline` class to the `<form>`** (same as the `.list-inline` class for a list `<ul>`):

```html
<form action="#" class="form-inline">
  <div class="form-group">
    <input type="email" class="form-control">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <input type="password" class="form-control">
   </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Sign In" class="btn btn-primary">
</form>
```

## Injecting a `.row` into the form

You can also inject a row inside a form. Here is an example with inputs for first name and last name:

```html
<form action="">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="first-name">First name</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="first-name" placeholder="Bob">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="last-name">Last name</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="last-name" placeholder="Sponge">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Rest of the form -->
</form>
```

## Your turn

- Now it's your turn to build a [responsive signup form](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/10-Login/).
- Try to customize your design a bit in `components/form.css`

NB: don't forget to **hard refresh** your browser (`cmd + shift + r`) to clear your browser's cache if your page doesn't seem to display your current code!
