## Background & Objectives

Practice using the Bootstrap utility classes. Learn how to use their classes to make various components.

## Specs

For this exercise the HTML is already coded for you on the `index.html`. All you have to do is add the right Bootstrap class to have the wanted behaviour. For example:

```html
<a href="#">I'm a link!</a>
```

To make this link a button you just have to add the class `btn btn-primary`:

```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">I'm a button now!</a>
```

## Further suggestions & resources

- Make sure to read the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/), they have a lot more to offer than `btn`, `list` and `img` classes!
