## Guidelines

### Setup
Before you start:

- Sign up to [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co)
- Sign up to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and install the desktop app from [this page](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

### Morning

- **9:00am to 10:30am**: Lecture
- **10:30am to 11:15am** (45 min) ðŸ‘‰ define your product pitch and primary persona
- **11:15am - 12:00am** (45 min) ðŸ‘‰ write down your core user journey and translate it into a user flow with [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co)
- **12:00am - 1pm** (60 min) ðŸ‘‰ build your UI kit and start working on your wireframe

For your product pitch, persona and user journey, make a copy of our [UX Research spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGCJLizpcROt0WwbGV_bCOxBktHO9XPdNHkXcZIyX1o/edit?usp=sharing) and complete the different templates.

### Afternoon

- **2pm to 2:15pm**: Lecture
- **2:30pm to 5:30pm**: finish your prototype and start adding the visual identity **only if you have time**. It's more strategic to have a kickass prototype in black and white rather than a poor mockup with lots of pictures and colors but that no one understands ðŸ˜¬.

Resources for design assets:

- **Fonts**: download and install `.ttf` fonts from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [getthefont](https://www.getthefont.com/)
- **Colors**: find them on [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) or use a color picker like [Colorzilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/)
- **Pictures**: you can use [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- **Icons**: download and use [Nucleo app](https://nucleoapp.com/) for utility icons

### Demo
When you are done, copy / paste your prototype URL in Kitt. To get the prototype URL, first play your prototype and then click on the `Share  Prototype` button like below:

<figure style="width: 100%">

</figure>

At 5:30pm, you will pitch your product by showcasing your prototype.

Good luck ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!
