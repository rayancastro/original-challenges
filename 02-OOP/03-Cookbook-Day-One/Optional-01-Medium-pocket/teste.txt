When you look at the lives and the experiences of people who were born in our lifetime, and compare them to the lives we have today, there’s only one deciding factor that has meant the difference, and made the total change happen.</p>
<p name="4f1b" id="4f1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s software.</p>
<p name="fe46" id="fe46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tech that changes the world all comes down to software.</p>
<p name="d9ba" id="d9ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are living in a connected planet now, where people who understand the language of the machines that we build have found a way for them to operate, talk to each other, and collaborate to make our world a more streamlined world than ever before.</p>
<p name="8ee0" id="8ee0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A story that people often tell is that on the day that the American colonies rebelled against England and started the American War of Independence, the King of England wrote in his diary that nothing of interest had happened that day.</p>
<p name="b380" id="b380" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How wrong he was!</p>
<p name="d51a" id="d51a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But in the past, news spread slowly. For news of what had happened in America to reach the King, he had to literally wait for a boat to arrive with a letter. That’s a long time ago. And it’s the opposite of the world today. Now, we know about the news of the day just seconds after it happened.</p>
<p name="97c0" id="97c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">News is shared through software. Software designed by talented developers.</p>
<p name="db28" id="db28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We can talk, constantly and consistently, to hundreds of people throughout the day without ever having to come face to face. Think about what that means for planet full of people who can now live connected lives as if they were right next door, while being on completely different planets at the opposite ends of the earth.</p>
<p name="fd80" id="fd80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a friend who is a tech journalist in New York City. We text and talk on the phone as if we’re living in the same suburb. Sure, there’s a time difference. But we don’t even notice it anymore.</p>
<p name="8adb" id="8adb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The power to have a decent, real conversation with another human being is the best hope we have for world peace. I honestly believe that.</p>
<p name="62d0" id="62d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conversations are shared through software. Software designed by talented developers.</p>
<p name="1ca8" id="1ca8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Health and wellness is an entirely new world, when you look at it through the lens of software and data. We are a long way past clunky machines that provide an unreliable diagnosis. Through software, patients have a better chance than ever before of being diagnosed and helped in the best possible way.</p>
<p name="95ba" id="95ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine how much better that’s going to be. Imagine the world – that is definitely coming – in which an application can tell you more about your body in 30 seconds than an X-ray and a day’s worth of tests could have told you 20–30 years ago. Imagine how our health will change. Our lifespan will change.</p>
<p name="2463" id="2463" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we’re healthier, through the power of software, imagine the flow-on effect that’s going to have on our relationships, our time and our productivity.</p>
<p name="479b" id="479b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Health is being changed through software. Software designed by talented developers.</p><p name="2448" id="2448" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I feel incredibly inspired by and excited about the future.</p>
<p name="c375" id="c375" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I feel excited by the fact that it’s enabled by software, and that software is being built by people who recognise that it’s a skill that can be learned, it’s a skill that can be enjoyed, and it’s never too late to be a skill that can be embraced, through code camps and programmes like <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/program/?ref=jonwestenberg-why-become-a-developer" data-href="https://www.lewagon.com/program/?ref=jonwestenberg-why-become-a-developer" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Le Wagon</strong></a>.</p>
<p name="d6b3" id="d6b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a world that is always changing, we know that software development is an important part of the transformation. It’s something that you can still get involved with today, and it’s a huge opportunity.</p>
<p name="2362" id="2362" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it’s not just a huge opportunity for your own career. It’s a huge opportunity for the world and the community in which you live today. More devs means more and better software, means an accelerated future for every single one of us.</p>
<p name="5697" id="5697" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that’s got to be worth signing up for.</p>
